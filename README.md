# Minesweeper Game

A vibrant and engaging Minesweeper game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features sound effects, difficulty levels, a timer, best time tracking, and a confetti celebration on winning!

## Play the Game
You can play the game directly on GitHub Pages: [Play Minesweeper](https://your-username.github.io/minesweeper-game/)

## How to Play
- Choose your difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) from the dropdown.
- **Left-click** a cell to reveal it. Itâ€™ll show a number (how many mines are nearby) or be blank (no nearby mines).
- **Right-click** to flag a cell you think has a mine (marked with a flag ðŸš©).
- Use the numbers to deduce where mines are. For example, a "1" means thereâ€™s 1 mine in the 8 surrounding cells.
- **Winning:** You win by revealing all safe cells (not containing mines). When you win, the message will say "You Win! All mines cleared," the board will flash, confetti will appear, and your time will be recorded as a Best Time!
- **Losing:** If you hit a mine, the game ends, and the message will say "Game Over! You hit a mine."
- Click the **"New Game"** button or the smiley face to start a fresh game with the same difficulty.
- Watch the timer to see how fast you can win, and check your Best Time for each difficulty!

## Features
- **Difficulty Levels:** Easy (8x8, 10 mines), Medium (10x10, 15 mines), Hard (12x12, 20 mines).
- **Sound Effects:** Beeps for revealing (different tones for each number), a tone for flagging, a cheer for winning, and a buzz for losing.
- **Timer and Best Time:** Tracks your playtime and saves the best time for each difficulty.
- **Visual Feedback:** Vibrant colors, cell animations, and confetti on winning.
- **Smiley Face:** Changes expressions based on game state (normal, worried, win, lose).
